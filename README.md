Movie Recommendation System softwares are built almosy by everywhere these days, but what sets this software apart is that it recommends movies based on POSTERS that you give as an input.
This software takes MOVIE POSTERS AS AN INPUT and recommends movies of similar genre.
This project was built completely on matlab as a part of a hackathon challenge by MathWorks.
A very major take away from this experience is that though Python is much easier to code in, we forget the basics: Matlab and other languages of slightly lower level compared to Python are really fast in terms of execution of codes and training of ML models.
The front-end for this project is built using Matlab App Designer.
